# Speech Recognition

This project is a simple example of how to use the speech_recognition library to recognize speech from an audio file.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine.

```commandline
$ git clone https://github.com/nne-nna/myvoice.git
```


Install the speech_recognition library. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```commandline
$ pip3 install SpeechRecognition
```



Run the Python script  in your terminal.

```commandline
$ python3 main.py
```

The program prints the recognized speech from the audio file 'nnenna.wav' to the console.

**Note:** Ensure that you have an active internet connection since the speech recognition program uses the Google Speech Recognition API engine.

## Exiting the Program

After the speech recognition, the program waits for 10 seconds before exiting and printing a message that indicates the end of the program.
